## Methods
**To prepare this data, the data was cleaned, and the following processes were performed:**
- Drop duplicates and fix inconsistencies in categorical data.
- Identify the features (X) and target (y): Assign the "Item_Outlet_Sales" column as your target and the rest of the relevant variables as your features matrix.
- Perform a train test split
- Create a preprocessing object to prepare the dataset for Machine Learning
- Imputation of missing values occurs after the train test split using SimpleImputer.

**Maching Learning Using the Following Models:**
- Linear regression model
- Random Forest Regressor Model
- Tuned/Best Random Forest Regressor Model
